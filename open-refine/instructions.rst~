Requirement: python >= 2.7
Installation: for the different platform, we could refer to this link:  https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions, for linux, we could just download the code, enter the directory and type ./refine in the shell. 
Explore data: just enter the directory and type ./refine in the shell
Interact between the GUI and Python environment:
run the open refine server by entering the OpenRefine directory and type ./refine
 
type the import part:
	from refine import Refine
import pandas
Explore the data through Open Refine by typing:
	df = pandas.read_csv("filename")
p = Refine(df)
After making changes to the data, we could get the new data by typing
	newdf = p.export_pandas_frame()
Then we could use pandas frame newdf to do the next step in data science.
