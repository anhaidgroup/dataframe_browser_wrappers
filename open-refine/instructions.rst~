Requirement: python >= 2.7
Installation: for the different platform, we could refer to this link:  https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions, for linux, we could just download the code, enter the directory and type ./refine in the shell. 
Explore data: just enter the directory and type ./refine in the shell
Interact between the GUI and Python environment:
run the open refine server by entering the OpenRefine directory and type ./refine
 
type the import part:
	from refine import Refine
import pandas
Explore the data through Open Refine by typing:
	df = pandas.read_csv("filename")
p = Refine(df)
After making changes to the data, we could get the new data by typing
	newdf = p.export_pandas_frame()
after calling export_pandas_frame, the openRefine project will be deleted automatically
Then we could use pandas frame newdf to do the next step in data science. 

Installation instructions

Requirements
------------
Python >= 2.7 or Python >= 3.3

Platforms
---------
Tested on ..

Dependencies
------------
1. Requests
2. Urllib
3. Open Refine


Instructions to use this wrapper
---------------------------------
1. First, for the different platform, we could refer to this link:  https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions, for linux, we could just download the code. 

2. Next, import explore module from pandastable wrapper directory like this:

  from refine import Refine
  
3. Finally, explore the dataframe using ExploreData command like this:
  
  df = pandas.read_csv('file.csv')
  
  app = ExploreData(df)

The above command will open a GUI filled with 'df' contents. The user can 
explore/update the dataframe in the GUI and after exploration he/she can 
close the GUI. The updated dataframe can be accessed using 'df' variable
directly.
